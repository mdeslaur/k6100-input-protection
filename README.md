# k6100 Input Protection Board

This is a reproduction of the Wells-Gardner k6100 Input Protection board
added to later date P314 boards.

It may not be worth adding these anymore as they can also cause problems,
but YMMV.

Gerbers for JLCPCB are located in the gerbers directory.
A PDF of the schematic and a 3d render are located in the Docs directory.
