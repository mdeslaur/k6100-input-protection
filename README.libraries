This project uses the following libraries:

k6100

It contains a modified version of the Kicad TO-92_Wide transistor with the
middle leg in the opposite direction like the original board.

It also contains a modified version of the Kicad
CP_Axial_L18.0mm_D6.5mm_P25.00mm_Horizontal capacitor but with pads added
for a radial cap, but it ultimately wasn't used due to routing issues.
